            <h3>Hey there! Welcome to my Portfolio!!!</h3>
            <p>I'm Dulmini Wanigasekara, a 19-year-old Computer Science undergraduate currently pursuing a Bachelor of 
                Science degree at the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), where I started in 2024. My educational 
                journey began at St. Thomas Girlsâ€™ High School in Matara, where I studied from 2016 to 2023, achieving my G.C.E. Ordinary Level certification 
                in 2023. I also completed a Foundation Certificate in Higher Education at IIT from 2023 to 2024.
                </p>
             <p>Beyond academics, I am actively involved in various extracurricular activities. I had the privilege of representing Sri Lanka as a junior karate team member, 
                winning 1st Runner-Up in the 13-14 Female Kumite +40kg category and achieving a National Black Belt in 2018. I've also participated in rugby, football (as a forward player), and track events, particularly excelling 
                in the 100m and 400m hurdles and relay events. My leadership skills were honed as a Junior and Senior Prefect at St. Thomas, and I enjoyed my involvement in the school's dancing and drama teams, where I developed teamwork and creative expression.</p>
